## Task Instructions:
Each Task should be committed in `contributors / <your roll number> / <task number> / file.txt`.

## Task Steps

1.  On the `main` branch, add the name of your favorite food to the first line of a designated text file.
   - **Commit:** Save this change with a commit message, such as `"Added favorite food"`.

2.  Create a new branch named `feature`, using the `main` branch as the base.

3.  On the `feature` branch, add the name of your dream company on the second line of the same text file.
   - **Commit:** Save this change with a commit message, like `"Added dream company"`.

4.  Switch back to the `main` branch and add the name of your city on the second line, just below your favorite food.

5.  Commit this change on the `main` branch with a message such as `"Added city name"`.

6.  Merge the `feature` branch into the `main` branch.

7.  Resolve any merge conflicts that arise during the merge process. The final format of the file should be:
   - **First line:** Favorite food
   - **Second line:** City name
   - **Third line:** Dream company

8.  Create a final commit after resolving the merge conflict. Ensure the commit message clearly indicates that the conflict has been resolved.

9.  Capture a screenshot showing all commits made during this task.
